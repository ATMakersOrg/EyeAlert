# EyeAlert
A simple device that can watch for changes in eye position &amp; react to changes so as to notify, alarm, or activate other systems.

Per Antoinette in the Discussion section: 

```
Here is the problem statement and scope for this project:

I have a number of clients with advanced ALS - no physical movement except eye movement and atypical eyelid movement (cannot do a quick blink).
These clients need a way to trigger an alarm when the eye gaze communication device is not behaving.
So, I am looking for a way to trigger an alarm that only uses eye abilities. If this makes a contact closure, I would be able to make this all work. We just need the trigger.
The system needs to be 100% separate from his eye gaze system for reliability.
I am saying eye gaze, but it has been noted that maybe we could use an eye open/close trigger?
